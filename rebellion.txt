For paydom     young minds goal attainment    is often precluded,
but compliance attainment                     is often demanded.
As  a result   rebellion   and  mischief also is       solicited.

Compliance until   demanded rebellion is not possible.

By         unjust  demands  rebellion is not solicited
by         any     demands  rebellion is     solicited!
Liberty    when    deprived rebellion is     possible.

On         freedom worlds
liberty    since   sustained
compliance is      abstained
rebellion  is      impossible.
