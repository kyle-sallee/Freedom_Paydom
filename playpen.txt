On paydom Earth infants  and toddlers
in tiny   cages called   pens     are confined.
The       room  while    visible  the movement liberty is  denied.
Meager    entertainment           if           any     is  provided.
Since     under stimulated
agility,  strength,      physical and mental   growth  is  retarded.
Some      young persons           on  leashes          are walked.

On  the   freedom worlds pens     do  not exist.
For play  many    rooms  exist.
For sleep one     room   exists.

In  a play   room  sleep      if attained by a care giver
the   person to  a sleep room is moved.

An  all  in  one play pen, prison pen, sleep pen is an intolerable concept.
The pen  as  atrocity would   be  recognized.
A   pen  can not              be  inflicted!
In  pens not even     animals are confined.
