Earth is a      transitional world.
At    different times
the   freedom   or
the   paydom    were sustained.
In    the       same region
both  if        sustained
war   is        inflicted.
The   free      minds are genocided or enslaved.

By  the paydom   the freedom when vanquished as manifest destiny is called.
For the converse a   word    is   not known.

With threat, war, weapons freedom      is never attained.
By   revolution   the     freedom      is never attained.
The  freedom  to  attain  liberty must be       sustained.

Most minds   when      free
the  bigoted colluding minds when    no longer obeyed
to   do      as        self  pleases is attained.
