On  paydom worlds      lethal deprivation  since inflicted
as  much   debauchery  as can be  afforded is            often purchased.
The        debauchery     can end lives.
By         debauchery     the     rich     slave persons self  terminate.
The        enslavement compliance to             attain
the        debauchery  must   be  purchased.
By         enslavement compliance or             infliction
the        slave       script for purchase is    attained.

Robin Williams,
"Cocaine is God's way of telling you you are making too much money."

On  freedom    worlds      liberty since   sustained
to  the        hilt     in hours   or      less
the sensation  appetite is daily   sated.
The deprivation                    since   abstained
the debauchery          is not     terminal.
The debauchery concept  as benign, normal, required is recognized.
