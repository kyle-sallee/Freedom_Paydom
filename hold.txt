On  paydom Earth  intentional kills daily  are inflicted.
On freedom worlds intentional kills seldom are inflicted.

On freedom    worlds for  an   unrelenting violent assault
as response   a      kill can  be          inflicted.
A  submission hold             is seldom   inflicted.

By  the  defender  a hold technique  could fail or        be countered.
By  the  assailant a kill technique  could                be attempted.
A   kill intention   when inflicted  a     kill technique is solicited.
For      violence    the  proclivity       when sustained
in  the  future      more victims    could become.

A   kill technique           to interrupt
the word liberty         can be shouted.
By       liberty   mercy can be solicited.

On  freedom worlds violence while seldom problematic
for hetero  sapien violence is           possible.
Persons     since  not perfect    worlds are not perfect.
