About  divinity,    origin,   morality a   reality approximation,
called religion, is created.  On       all worlds  religion exists.

On  Earth      by  bigoted         religious minds
the technology is  deprived    is  hoarded,  and
the crusades   and inquisition are inflicted.

On Earth          towards control, compliance, threats the religions are bent.
On freedom worlds towards liberty, compassion, reuse   the religions are bent.

As    nature's   custodians                      religions persons act.
Fire, flood,     mud slide, damaged areas by the religious persons are reseeded.
More  food plants    and    less    dense trees  exists.
From  effort    over centuries
in    more           environments   the   food   plants thrive and grow.
On    soil,     on   water, and     some  on     sea    water      grow.
Ideal cultivation    irrigation     technologies while  known  are not required.

Food as  a  birthright as a divine gift since    considered
some religious persons are  food   and  culinary zealots.
