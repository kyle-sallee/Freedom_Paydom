The  freedom, the castedom, the paydom worlds and jan ken pon seem similar.
On   freedom      worlds by 5%  or     less   denizens
the  production   when      performed  a      castedom is approximated.
By   bigoted      minds     the production    persons  if selected
a    castedom     enslavement                          is inflicted.
The  freedom      world     denizens          against
the  castedom     favoring  bigoted    minds  must     guard.

The  castedom     worlds           are not sustainable
the  deprivation  and       revolt are     solicited.
Into paydom       worlds                   devolve.

The  paydom       worlds by disease, famine, pollution, and war end.
Or   freedom      worlds    become.

The  castedom     worlds    exist,   but   liberty    since not sustained,
are  really       paydom    variants.
More paydom       world     variants exist than can   be    described.
From castedom     world     bigoted  minds on   Earth when  born
the  castedom     is        created  and   sustained.
