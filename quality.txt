Quality is a relative measurement.

On  paydom  worlds   to last  nothing       is made.
To  self    destruct          everything    is made.
To  profit  importance  since accorded
to  quality importance  is    deprived.

By  lawsuit when        made  unprofitable     only
the lethal  product           production    is ended.

On  freedom worlds to profit all importance is deprived.
To  be awesome
to  be enduring
to  be improved
to  be modular
to  be repaired  all goods   are made.
Quality  because exceptional production rates are reduced.
Like sea turtles the turtle  homes  for centuries last.
