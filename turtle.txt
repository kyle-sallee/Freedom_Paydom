On at   least  one    freedom world the turtle home       is popular.
A  sand buried turtle with          the shell  protruding if imagined suffices.

Rather than  a    roof     above   ground a transparent dome protrudes.
The    walls are  circular modular and      below ground.
By     the   home rain water       is       purified    and  stored.
Solar  energy     is   collected   and
both   chemically and  phosphorescently     stored.
As     required   the  energy can  be       broadcast   and  shared.

In each home neck storage  areas      exist.
To the  neck the  entrance connects.  The neck is the least comfortable.

In    turtle   home  communities  paved    roads do  not exist.
For   walking  and   bicycling    suitable paths         exist.
Fruit bushes,  fruit trees, fruit and      vegetable     gardens
are   abundant and   by     the   homes    irrigated and fertilized.

Unlike the paydom concrete jungles by turtle home communities
nature is  not    destroyed, but rather appreciated and preserved.
