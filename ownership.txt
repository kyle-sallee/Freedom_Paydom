By  Dutch  persons   from       indigenous persons
for some   junk,     estimated  at  60     guilders value,
the Manhattan        island     ownership  was      purchased.  How?

The land   ownership idea       was not comprehended.
In  a      boat      the island can not be packed  and moved.
The trespassers will be confined, enslaved, killed and robbed idea
if  explained   the  Dutch     as dangerous wild   animals would be regarded.

The land       ownership ideas is a person control justification idea.
By  indigenous persons
the land       ownership idea when    not empowered
the invasion   defense   idea also is not empowered.
The Europeans  were      pathogenic.
The danger     afore     realization
the indigenous persons   were being       genocided.

By  bigoted minds the  enslavement to        inflict
the air,    land, sea, water       ownership ideas are endorsed.
On  freedom worlds     those       ideas           are abstained.
