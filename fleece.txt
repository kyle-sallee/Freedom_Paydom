By   Executive Order 6102         in 1933
by   the  gold       reserve act  of 1934
gold coin possession then    most
gold any  possession was     made illegal!
The       slaves     were         fleeced!

On   freedom worlds   bigoted minds do not exist do not collude
thus the     persons  are not fleeced.
Anything     produced can be  kept.
But  when    asked        is  happily given.
