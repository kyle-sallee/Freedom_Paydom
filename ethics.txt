Paydom   ethics    follow.
Comply,  earn,     food buy or  by  starvation be executed!
  Lawful as good   is regarded
Unlawful as evil   is regarded.
By legislation
by prosecution     atrocities       are  inflicted.
Liberty  is seldom comprehended nor even considered.

On   freedom      worlds      liberty since sustained
law, legislation, prosecution         are   abstained.
Liberty     when  sustained   action  is    righteous.
Liberty     when  deprived    action  is    atrocious.

Freedom ethics  and   paydom  ethics        conflict.
Law and liberty since contrary
to  one only          importance can  be    accorded.
