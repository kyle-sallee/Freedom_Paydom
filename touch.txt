From the freedom the touch  game    was imported.
On   the back    and torso  points  can be    scored.
On   the arms    and hands  points  are not   scored.
With     easy        goals  points  to  score fewer fingers are required.
At       hard        goals  points  to  score all   fingers and
forward  body        movement       is  required.
At   the max         goals  martial     artists     only    compete.

The    touch game and   pugilism seem similar,
except brain and  face  damage   is   not inflicted.
Wing   chun  if   known          is   a   better approximation.
By     electronics      points   are  scored.
Few    eyes  are  sufficiently        fast.

On  paydom  worlds  rather than to the players
to  the     game
to  the     rules   the    importance     is accorded.  Players are hurt.
On  freedom worlds  many   paydom similar    games exist,
but the     brain   and    bone   damage  is abstained, because
to  the     person  the    importance     is accorded.
