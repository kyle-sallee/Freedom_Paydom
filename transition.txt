Culturcide,  genocide, law,       manifest destiny, war   when     inflicted
by  the      paydom               the    freedom          was      replaced.
Until        around    1600 AD,
the   North  American  continent  by     freedom cultures was      populated.
Money was    not       empowered. Travel passes, visas,   were not required.
By           colluding bigoted    minds  enslavement      was  not inflicted.
From  Europe colluding bigoted    slaver minds   arrived  and
the   North  American  Freedom    ended.

Liberty  when sustained  the freedom is attained.
Atrocity by   infliction the  paydom is sustained.

Atrocity      and    liberty    since   contrary  one only   can be selected.
From a paydom world  to       a freedom world     the transition if abstained
all    paydom worlds ultimately self    destruct.

Each   persons       liberty    when    sustained the freedom    is attained.
Each   persons'      decisions  matter!
