On   paydom worlds appearance, ethnicity, attributes, roles, wealth are admired.
On  freedom worlds goal        attainment and liberty sustainment   are admired.

On   paydom   worlds slave produced goods slave produced services to attain
the  required wealth is    admired  is    desired.

All  persons and self as persons     when perceived
most aspects          as superficial seem.
By   goal    attainment
by   liberty sustainment
the  persons differ.

By   action  many persons when benefited
a    great        action       became.
A    great        action  to   attain for some is goal.

For  most    to   admiration   importance      is not      accorded.
In   every   day  life         excellence when    attained suffices.
