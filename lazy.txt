On  paydom  worlds  a  flawed     expectation  exists.
All needs   sans       payment    if  provided laziness results is expected.
All day,    all week,  all  year, how long can a mind be lazy?
On  freedom worlds     that much  laziness     while possible  does not become.
On  freedom worlds all activities sans cost    when  available why  do  nothing?
The laziness           hypothesis was  always        incorrect.

On   paydom   worlds slaves    to    obtain
the  energy,  food,  home,     water        are deprived.
With slavery  when   compliant slave script is  given.
With slave    script continued existence    is  purchased.
Each slave    life   as        hostage      is  regarded and
for  noncompliance   by        deprivation  is  executed.

On  freedom worlds liberty since sustained deprivation is not inflicted.
The minds   are    ambitious.
By  self    and    by life span  the  self can         be     impeded.

On  paydom worlds products and services   while mostly produced
on freedom worlds goals    and attainment are   mostly produced.
