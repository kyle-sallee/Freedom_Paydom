An atrocity  when  endured a person   feels unimportant.
By atonement when  done    a person   as      important feels.
To contrary  ideas the     importance when  deprived
an atonement becomes.

On     paydom   worlds    atonement   does not exist.  A tort system exists.
Rather than     voluntary atonement
by the courts involuntary restitution is       forced.

On   freedom   worlds
liberty since sustained
money   is    abstained.
That atrocities  can  be      undone
that restitution      is      possible
by   free minds       are not pretend.
To   feel appreciated and     important to cause is possible.
