Liberty    deprivation        when anticipated
anger      and  or      fear  are  solicited.
Compliance when favored fear  is   solicited.
Defiance   when favored anger is   solicited.

By fear      when      endured       volition while mitigated is not deprived.
A  befuddled compliant mind when not attained
an afraid              mind often    complies, but
an angry               mind can      defy.

On  paydom worlds each day   with      threats    with fear minds are poisoned.
By  bigoted minds from slave minds 98% compliance is   desired.
The liberty illusion   is    desired.

On  freedom   worlds with anger and fear minds are not poisoned.
Six years     afore  attained   for air, land, water
the challenge and    fear       by  all        is      surmounted.
By  the young minds  self powered aircraft, boats, and vehicles are piloted.
And swimming  skills are  attained.
Death only is feared,     because on paydom world rebirth is possible.
