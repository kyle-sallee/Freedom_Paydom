On   paydom     worlds conquer   is  endlessly inflicted.
The  conquerors become masters.
The  conquered  become slaves.
The  minds      when   conquered the persons   comply.

By              law and order
the  control                  is    sustained.
By   conquerors law and order is    desired.
Upon conquered  law and order is    inflicted.
A    choice                   is    deprived.
The             law and order while sustained
the  peace                    is    attained
but  liberty                  is    abstained.

As   conquered  when  born
the  liberty    since never     experienced
as   deprived   as    absent as beneficial  will       seldom   be realized.
Like domesticated     livestock persons     will live, produce, be fleeced.
The  socialization    to defy   when unable the        persons     comply.
Cows say        moo.  Slaves    say  money.
