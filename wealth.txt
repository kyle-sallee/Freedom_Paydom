All persons if wealthy the menial minimal pay wage slave labor who will perform?

On paydom  worlds poverty    and   wealth to    make deprivation is inflicted.
On freedom worlds ask        and   give   since done deprivation is abstained.
On freedom worlds meaningful tasks only   are   done.

On freedom worlds liberty, life,    health since valued
credit,    debt,  money,   poverty, wealth and   similar ideas
are        not    empowered.

Sans menial tasks worlds are possible.
The  menial tasks        to  machines to robots to cron scheduled programs
can  be     delegated.

By  money meniality while sustained   a  menial world     is  sustained.
By  the   paydom    the   technological  growth           is  retarded.
The deprivation     when  sufficient  as machines persons are regarded.
