One  person   from a   pond    1/4th the snow was    shoveled.
One  person   threw    down    water to  keep the ice slippery.
Many persons  came     and     skated.
To   expand   and      repair  the   ice
by   visitors NOTHING  was     done.
The  paydom   is       like    that.
One  person   does     everything
many persons  benefit,
do   not      contribute,      and
the  project  is       ruined.

In   free     software production
in   free     pond     skating
this typical  slave    behavior                        is  evident.
By   some     takers   the     original  project       is  ruined.

The  freedom  differs. The     freedom   persons       are intelligent.
By   every    visitor  a       couple    snow  strips  are removed.
The  snow     when     all     cleared   water buckets are brought.
The  first    person   when    returning the   ice     is  perfect.
