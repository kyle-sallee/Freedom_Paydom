On  the North American     continent in particular
pacifism               as  cowardice is regarded and
corporeal punishment   as  righteous is regarded.

On  freedom worlds
the violence   rarely  is  inflicted.
Any violence   when        inflicted
by  violence   can     be  ended.
The atrocity   while   not justified
the complicity is      not justified.
To  liberty    max         importance when      accorded
the liberty    to          restore    action is required.

The untrained  persons     fail,      fall, flail, flee.
The martial    artists     techniques when  wielded
the least      atrocious   outcomes   are   attained.
A   pacifist   to          become
a   martial    artist must become.
