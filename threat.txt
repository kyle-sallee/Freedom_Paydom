For non compliance an atrocity must be endured when anticipated a threat exists.
Tacit   and explicit   threats  are  possible.
For the     atrocity   deprivation   often suffices.

On paydom worlds by banks by cohorts by employers by legislators by parents
by police threats   are   daily         inflicted.
What   is important and   meaningful to explore      to ponder
by        threats   that  consideration and duration is deprived.

On  freedom worlds compliance, punishment, responsibility,  retribution, threat,
and all     that   non         sense       since            abstained
a   meaningful     life        is not      precluded!
A   threat  less   life        feels       better, happier, relaxing.
To  cower   to     comply      since       not     honed
to  threats the    best        responses   can     become.
By  threat  infliction         liberty     deprivation      since intended
the best    response is        liberty     sustained.
