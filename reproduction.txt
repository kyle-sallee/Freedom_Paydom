On  Earth more  than half   the pregnancies among persons are unplanned.
By  abortion         many       pregnancies               are terminated.
The deprivation to   resist the families                  are useful.

On  freedom   worlds      liberty since sustained  deprivation is abstained.
The unplanned pregnancies           are extremely  rare
the abortion                        is  never      advantageous.
In  vitro     fertilization         is  normal     and
by  care      givers      surrogacy is  normal.
The genetic   diseases              are gone.
Biologically  related     persons       separately live and seldom interact.

On   freedom worlds             a  person can not be owned.
Even by      biological parents a  person can not be owned.
By   trained motivated  care       persons
the  very    best       regard  is provided.

On   primitive  freedom worlds the  old fashion method while used
the  parenting  is      abstained.  For groups  care   is    provided and
by   emulation  the     roles       are learned.
