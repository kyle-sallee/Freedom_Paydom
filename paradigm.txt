The paydom success paradigm is    unhealthy is  diseased.
Comply,    cheat,  fail,    quit, win       are worthless ideas.

But  paydom minds with   menticide    are      so inundated
that so     many  absurd ideas about  compliance, duration, expectation, failure
are  empowered,   and    as    mental manacles    worn.
By   illness      by     ideas        volition is already   defeated.

An  adequate       reality  approximation follows.
To  do     what is desired  one's entire  life             is  available.
By  death  by      quitting alone the     desired outcomes are precluded.
For free   minds   this     realization                    is  banal.

Free minds since free for an entire life time one's apex or epitome
can  be sought,  discovered, enjoyed.
The  difference  to explain  mere words   do not suffice.
The   paydom     is deceit,  deprivation, enslavement, toxic!
The  freedom     is life,    enjoyment,   excellence   exceeded!
