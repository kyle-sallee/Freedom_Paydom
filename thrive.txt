A   free    mind on paydom worlds  when born are often unhappy.
By  culture a       social disease when approximated.
the interaction                    is   abrasive.

To  thrive    the choice     is  not     made.
The sunlight, the water,     the soil if ideal   thriving becomes.
In  the       same condition not all     plants  thrive.
In  the       same culture   not all     persons thrive.

For not thriving the plant  if not culpable
for not thriving the person is not culpable.

On paydom Earth when not thriving the person is blamed,      is confined,
is drugged,     with electricity  is  shocked,  lobotomized, or killed.

The  endured atrocity solicited unhappiness by
more endured atrocity is not    solved!

By free  minds the  paydom culture is not enjoyed!
By slave minds the freedom culture is not enjoyed!
