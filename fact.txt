On   paydom    worlds
by   authority purporting minds
by   atrocity  infliction by    threat          infliction
the  bigoted   minds'     opinions
as   facts     are        asserted              and
by   slave     minds      unquestioningly       empowered.
With commands  even       when              not compliant
with facts     slave      minds                 comply.
By   law       mongers    and           by      criminals
to   money     value      is                    accorded.
As   valuable  as fact    when asserted is  not doubted.
An   outlaw    and a      free mind     are not tantamount.

On  freedom    worlds  ideas,     mere opinions,  as facts are not empowered.
The unknowable reality by opinion when approximated
a              reality                 approximation becomes.

Control when desired a  bad reality approximation, deceit, when inflicted
an      atrocity     is inflicted.
