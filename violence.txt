On  paydom   Earth   violence while daily inflicted
by  few      persons martial  arts  is    trained.
The intended control                is    seldom thwarted.

On  freedom  worlds     liberty     since  sustained
a   violent  atrocity               while  infrequent  is      possible.
In  martial  arts       training                       is      possible.
An  atrocity when       inflicted   justification      is  not possible.
A   violent             atrocity    when   inflicted
by  killing          if interrupted the    atrocity    since   ended
the liberty          is restored.
A   couple   strikes if attempted the word  liberty    is      shouted.
A   barrage          if attempted a   kill  can        be      solicited.
A   single   quick      technique can kill.
An  atrocity         if unopposed           complicity becomes.
An  assailant        if unopposed a   kill  could      be      inflicted.

Edmund Burke, "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil
 is for good men to do nothing."
Atrocity infliction and atrocity complicity are equally atrocious.
