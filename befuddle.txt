On paydom worlds for the same atrocity different words exist.

arrest			abduction
capital punishment	murder
imperialization		culturcide
imprisonment		confinement
law			threat
prosecution		persecution
taxation		extortion
war			mass murder

For       conquerors   and
the       conquered
different regard since accorded for the same atrocities
different words  are   used.

On  freedom worlds duplicity language is  not inflicted.
All persons as     persons            are     regarded.
