Unlike paydom worlds fear is   confronted and courage is honed.
During baby   years  by   all  swimming   is  mastered.
From   age    2      bicycles, boats,     and pedal powered mobility is learned.
From   age    4      aircraft             are learned.

The    initial     air  craft are    pedal     powered sail    planes.
By     a         4 year old   an     aircraft  can  be lifted, literally.
From   transparent aluminum   carbon frame     and     fully   translucent wings
       excellent   visibility becomes.
The    initial     aircraft   are    single    seat.
By     radio       remote     piloting         assistance is possible.
For    rudder      elevator   forward   canard aircraft
fatal  stalls and  spins      are       precluded.
Skills when        attained   altitude, aqua   and  velocity are not feared.

Birthdays are not  celebrated.  To    age  importance is  not accorded.
Accomplishments    and   skill  attainment instead    are     celebrated.
Aircraft, bicycle, boat, dance, running,   scooter,   swim,   etc...
the       skills   when  attained          celebrations       become.
On        freedom  worlds       being      noob       is      fun!
