Nippon  was starving.    World War II was nearly lost.
Culturcide, enslavement, rape         was anticipated.
All person  dies.
The nation  to continue the brave must die now was asserted.
The "good man"       to  become
to  self importance  was deprived and
to  duty importance  was accorded.

Menticide        if    not considered
the kamikaze     were  not forced.
On  20th century Earth the  paydom was extolled.
Rather   than    to         self       continuation
                 to         paydom     continuation
more     importance    was  commonly   accorded.

On  freedom worlds liberty since sustained
for life    for    nature  for   persons importance is  sustained
the famine  the    rape    the   war                are abstained.

The kamikaze and life since contrary only one can be extolled.
