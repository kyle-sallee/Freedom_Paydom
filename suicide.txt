On   paydom  Earth  suicide  daily             becomes.
Living       while                        not  hated
the  atrocities,    control, deprivation,      enslavement,
and  illness                 daily        when endured are hated.
The  suicide while           criminalized is   still       done.

From healthy food and ample     exercise excellent longevity becomes.
Bio- tech    also is  excellent.
When requested    in  legs
tiny glucose powered  axial     pumps    are       installed.
The  heart   when     faltering the      blood     still     flows.

Coronary     heart disease while  seldom fatal
with age     organ efficiency     still  declines.
Even with    bio   tech;   immortality   is not attained.
And  eventually    when    ready
the  current journey       is     ended  so
the  next    journey       can    begin.
As   self    desires       to     live   and to die the liberty is sustained.
