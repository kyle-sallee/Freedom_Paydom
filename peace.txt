Enslavement if minted
one side    is war
one side    is peace.

By  war the   conquered   are decided and enslaved.
By  law the   enslavement is  sustained.

The law where inflicted
the war never actually    ends.
Non compliant persons     are still captured, confined, or killed.

On      freedom worlds liberty since     sustained
persons are not conquered
persons are not enslaved.
The     authority idea also    since not empowered
the     peace     idea
the     war       idea
while   not       easily       comprehended
the     atrocity  inflicting   colluding bigoted minds
are               easily       comprehended.
