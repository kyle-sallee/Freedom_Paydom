From    the   freedom when            originating
the     greed idea    is   not easily comprehended.
Perhaps for   greed   to       become deprivation must be endured?
From    envy  greed   originates?

By   wealth attainment greed  if  sated

Enslavement when complicit some wealth is    attained.
Enslavement when inflicted more wealth is    attained.
Enslavement and  liberty               since contrary

The  reality approximation if        insufficient please forgive.
From freedom minds         are   not greedy.
The  proclivity            since not attained     since  not thwarted
the  cause                 is        merely       surmised.
