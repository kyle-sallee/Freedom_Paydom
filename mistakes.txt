On  paydom Earth  a mistake  when  made if not hid
the person is       defamed, persecuted, prosecuted.
The worst  mistakes are      often denied  and hid.

On freedom worlds a person  is not defamed is not  persecuted is not prosecuted.
Mistakes   when   corrected when   discovered when published;
admiration is     solicited.
