John Dalberg Acton,
"Power tends to  corrupt and    absolute power corrupts absolutely.
 Great men   are almost  always bad      men."

J.K. Rowling's book   character Voldemort,
"There is no   good   and evil,
 there is only power, and those too weak to seek it."

With  power  since        contrary   from        all nations
the          liberty  is  expunged.
Power when   desired  to  others the importance  is  deprived and
to    owned  opinions the importance             is  accorded.
The   self's opinions as  superior   when certain
the   power           as  justified  when certain
the   mind   with         bigotry                is  corrupted.
The   power  to want  a   bigoted    mind        is  required.

By    free   minds
the   power  idea     as  liberty    deprivation is  recognized.
The   power  monger   as  derisive   comedy acts are performed.
